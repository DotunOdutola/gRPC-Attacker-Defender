# Capstone Course Spring 2020
* 20May2020 - 05Aug2020
* Topic: Penetration Testing Understanding, Framework, and Abstraction
* Student: Adedotun ("Dotun") Odutola
* Instructor: Dr. Drew Springall

# Goals
* *Explore* and *experiment* with common penetration testing tools, techniques,
  and defenses
    * All usage of attacker-oriented tools must be on a closed and controlled
      (ideally virtual) network and hosts
    * Great care should be taken to ensure that no other entity is negatively
      impacted by exporation and experimentation
    * When in-doubt, discuss with the instructor prior to performing any action
      that may negatively impact any other person, organization, or company
* *Understand* the classical penetration testing efforts and processes
    * Targets and tactics of the classical stages
    * Common workflows and approaches
    * Rationale and justification of the above
* *Understand* the classical detection and defense efforts and processes
    * Network infrastructure components and topologies
    * Host-based techniques and data sources
    * Analytical frameworks to leverage various data-sources
* *Engineer* and *develop* an attacker-/defender-specific framework to replicate
  common tactics and actions by each actor
    * Logical abstractions separating _intent_ from _act_
    * Reusable and extendable
    * Automatable (but not automated) usage by arbitrary
* *Evaluate* and *explain* the various design decisions of the framework and
  envisioned usage
    * How various aspects improve the attacker/defender's toolkit
    * How could be leveraged in the real-world in a "live fire" scenario
    * How could be expanded and customized for future needs

# Grading
The student's final grade will be dependent on the instructor's overall
evaluation of the student's progress throughout the semester and the end-state.
In lieu of a final exam, the student will present their project in its completed
form for analysis and examination to the instructor and other knowledgable
personel.

It is the instructor's responsibility to ensure that the student is provided
with adequate feedback throughout the semester. This will ensure that the
student has ample opportunity to course-correct and re-adjust effort if needed.

# Collaboration and Coordination
The student and instructor will collaborate and coordinate regularly throughout
the course of the semester. In addition to weekly VTC meetings, email will be
used as needed to provide updates, guidance, and details.

# Schedule
Given the difficulties posed by current events, the below is an *extremely*
rough-sketch as of the start of the semester. It will be adjusted as the
semester progresses and should not be seen as a template for 

* Weeks 1/2: Setup, background, and infrastructure
* Week 3: Explore attacker strategy, techniques, and tactics
* Weeks 4: Attacker-side experimentation and design
* Week 5: Explore defender strategy, techniques, and tactics
* Weeks 6: Defender-side experimentation and design
* Weeks 7/8: Framework experimentation, engineering, and implementation
* Weeks 9/10: End-to-end framework experimentation, evaluation, and analysis
* Week 11: Preperation for presentation and submission of project
